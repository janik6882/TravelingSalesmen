# TravelingSalesmen
Simple Python Program for solving the Traveling Salesmen Problem with brute force. Works with Python 2.6 and up.

This program is  available in two languages, german (cause I'm a german student) and english (for international purposes). Both versions should be identical aside from the language differences you can obviously see.
